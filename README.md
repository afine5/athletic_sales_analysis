Module 5 Homework

This one was particularly challenging because I kept inadvertently outputting a series, and was trying to understand when and how to convert it to a df. I learned it came down to resetting the index.

I also learned about resampling and the letters that act as a grouping type.

I used ChatGPT to help me through the parts that didn't make sense to me. I also referenced several tutorials on YouTube to better understand the capabilities of groupby and pivot tables.
